# ðŸ“· EOS R5 settings

These are my EOS R5 camera settings.

NOTE: After loading settings from card, turn camera off and on to avoid random fuckery.

## History

### 2022-02-06 â†’ CAMSET03.CSD â†’ Baby got BACK (button focus)

Implemented [Brett Carlsen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv8214tuW1Z7W-T1kZAXMug)'s "[Professional Autofocus Setup for the Canon R5 (and R6) - eye AF + back button AF](https://youtu.be/sqLQ-TzwCis)".

And **also** set the joystick ("multi-controllers" ðŸ¤”) to control the AF point (instead of the default behavior of **doing fucking nothing** (!!! (ðŸ¤¯)) while shooting. (I think Brett just forgot this was the default, already having it set, and thus didn't show it in his video.)

- `C.Fn3` â†’ `Customize buttons`

    - `Shutter butt. half-press` â†’ `*` (`AE lock (while button pressed)`)

    - `AF operation` â†’ `SERVO`

    - `AF method` â†’ `Spot AF`

- `C.Fn3` â†’ `Customize buttons` (again)

### 2022-02-06 â†’ CAMSET01.CSD

These are the default settings. I used the `Reset Camera` function in the camera UI to reset all of the settings to default, to provide a starting point for customization.
